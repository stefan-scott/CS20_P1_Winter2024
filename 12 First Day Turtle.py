    my_turtle.forward(distance)
    my_turtle.left(45)

# PROGRAM TWO - a few more instructions
# my_turtle.fd(50)  #.fd() is short for forward()
# my_turtle.lt(37)  #.lt() is short for left()
# my_turtle.fd(202)
# my_turtle.goto(0,0)  #return to origin with goto()


# PROGRAM ONE - basic movement
# my_turtle.forward(100)   # move forward 100 units (pixels)
# my_turtle.right(45)      # turn right 45 degrees
# my_turtle.backward(200)  # backward 200 units


# program end (optional)
window.exitonclick()  # loop waiting for user to click on canvas
